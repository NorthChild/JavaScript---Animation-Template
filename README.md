# JavaScript - Animation Physics Playgrounds

-- 'training wheel' code collection for making animation and game physics on JavaScript --

Back when i first started programming, this set of 'training wheel' codes 
would have been the kind of stuff that would have saved some me some time while playing 
around with animations and games physics.

most if not all are set for a 400W x 400H

i suggest code adaptation only once you fully understand the logic behind the codes, i have to admit, 
when i first did these, just being able to fully and autonomously write the code, 
that was a proud moment of success, a moment i suggest experiencing.


- OBJ-Re_Spawn : has all you need to make an object re-spawn as it passes a certain x coordinate 
  (code is easily readjustable for any size over 400x400 and/or any other coordinate other than x)
  * contains graphed environment & mouse tracker
  
- OBJ_Bouncing_physics : has all you need to make an object bounce when it hits a certain x coordinate
  (code is easily readjustable for any size over 400x400 and/or any other coordinate other than x)
  * contains graphed environment & mouse tracker
  
- more interesting animation physics to come ....... 




P.S all playgrounds come with a graphed environment, i left it in since it provides a nice way to check
x and y values, and a mouse tracker, useful to have a real-time idea of where your mouse is pointing 
if you're interested in the graphs all by themselves, theres my other repo (JavaScript-Graphed_Backgrounds)
with more than one choice in graph/lined paper backgrounds.
