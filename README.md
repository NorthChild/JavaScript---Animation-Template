# JavaScript - Animation Physics Playgrounds

-- 'training wheel' code collection for making animation and game physics on JavaScript --

I myself started this project as a beginner with only 6 months of coding under the belt.
so in this repository all i'm going to do, is add 'training wheel' code, 
stuff that would have saved some time while playing around with animations and games physics.

most if not all are set for a 400W x 400H, and most if not all have a graded and lined  
'paper feel' graph structure, all adjustable depending on your needs, whether it be size or simply
remove the graphing structure, i just included it cos it looks neat, if you 
want just the graph structure, theres another file inside this repo, instead of making changes
to the ones containing the moving objects (if you're new to coding, i suggest taking the graphed
paper code by itself, you never know what could go wrong when attempting to adjust a code to your 
needs, that is, IF, you're really new at coding!)

i suggest using these only once you fully understand the logic behind the code, i have to admit, 
when i first did these, just being able to fully autonomously write the code, 
was a proud moment of success, a moment i suggest experiencing.


- OBJ-Re_Spawn : has all you need to make an object re-spawn as it passes a certain x coordinate 
  (code is easily readjustable for any size over 400x400 and/or any other coordinate other than x)
  contains graphed environment
  
- OBJ_Bouncing_physics : has all you need to make an object bounce when it hits a certain x coordinate
  (code is easily readjustable for any size over 400x400 and/or any other coordinate other than x)
  contains graphed environment
  
- more interesting animation physics to come ....... 

- Graphed_Environment : tesing environment code, provides a lined graphing and a ruler on both 
  ends of the x axis and y axis, the environment also displays mouse position (x,y values) that 
  swithces displayed text in case of running-out-of-virtual-space-syndrome, pretty helpful template
  for when you feel creative but you also need to have an idea of where you're looking at.
  small tip on reading the ruler ( - while reading the ruler on y-axis: the y value matches the 
  line which the diplayed value rests on - while reading on x-axis: the x value matches the square 
  space count, either way, you can use the mouse tracket to corroborate graphed x,y values)
